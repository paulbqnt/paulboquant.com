# Hiram, Option Pricing Library


Hiram is a free financial library built in Python that can be used for option pricing and financial instruments management.

I started to think about this project while I was studying Option Pricing at University Panthéon-Sorbonne. I quickly realised how difficult it could be to improve intuition regarding pricing and greeks. My goal with Hiram is to:

    Improve my intuition about options and greeks
    Show how easy to use Python is
    Show far I could go in the modeling of financial products.

The code below is the first showcase of my library. You can find the Jupyter Notebook on github. Before the creation of that blog post I shared the notebook on LinkedIn.

1. Option Creation and Pricing

from option import BlackScholes, Way_option
example_call = BlackScholes(way=Way_option.call, S=100, K=105, T=1, r=0.05, sigma=0.3, )
example_call.dict() #Pydantic BaseModel function, makes the output easier to read

# Output
```json
{'S': 100.0,
'K': 105.0,
'T': 1.0,
'r': 0.05,
'sigma': 0.3,
'way': <Way_option.call: 'call'>,
'stock': None,
'quantity': 1,
'price': 1,
'id_': UUID('ad45fecd-e22c-4071-9e28-64799e7fbf78')}

2. Greeks
Delta
$$Δ=∂V∂SΔ=∂S∂V​$$

Delta 0.53 or 53%. For 1€ rise (fall) in the spot price the value of the long call position will increase (decrease) by about 0.53€. S (spot) and V (option value) move in the same direction.

example_call.delta()

# Output
0.5338376178017635

```python
ways = [Way_option.call, Way_option.put]
example_port2 = Portfolio()

# let's write and add 100 options in our portfolio
for i in range(0,100):
    temp_stock = choice(stocks_list)
    temp_option = BlackScholes(way=choice(ways),
                      S = uniform(temp_stock.price * 0.5,temp_stock.price * 1.5),
                      K = uniform(temp_stock.price * 0.5,temp_stock.price * 1.5),
                      T = uniform(0.02, 3.0),
                      r = uniform(0.01, 0.15),
                      sigma = uniform(0.1, 0.75),
                      quantity = uniform(1, 2000),
                      price = uniform(10, 150),
                     stock = temp_stock)
    example_port2.add_underlying(temp_option)
```
